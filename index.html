                    <p class="section-head">About Therapy</p>
                    <p>
                        There is a real possibility that you may feel worse at-times in therapy than when you started. This is because you may have
                        to address some uncomfortable and painful issues. This is normal and should be anticipated. The length
                        of therapy is determined by you. The amount of work that you are willing to do determines the speed
                        and direction of your therapy. Your therapist will make recommendations for continued service, but
                        feel free to give your input as-well.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-head">Limits to Confidentiality</p>
                    <p>
                        Although confidence is very strict in therapy, there are some occasions when confidentiality must be broken: If there is
                        ongoing child abuse. This includes physical, emotional and/or sexual abuse. If you are or become
                        suicidal, or you pose a threat to the safety of another. We are required to protect you, notify the
                        authorities, and warn whomever may be in-danger. If you are ever in a court of law and use your mental
                        status as a factor in your case. Your notes may be subpoenaed by the court and we are required to
                        provide all requested information.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without going into extreme details, third-party providers are entitled to know diagnosis, treatment, and/or prognosis. Otherwise,
                        you control the release of information and on your initial visit.

                    <p class="section-head">Appointments</p>
                    <p>
                        Sessions are 45-55 minutes in length, beginning 10-15 minutes after the hour. The therapists at Canyon Counseling Center
                        try to see their clients promptly at the appointment time scheduled. They request that you also be
                        responsible for keeping appointments on time. If you are late, your sessions will be shortened. <strong>Please
                        do not bring young children to therapy. In case of appointments not kept or canceled with less than
                        24 hours notices, you will be charged in-full for that session.</strong> Insurance and other third-party
                        providers do not cover missed session charges. (Emergency exceptions made).
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-head">Insurance Billing</p>
                    <p>
                        As a professional courtesy to you, our office will bill your insurance company, where appropriate, on a weekly basis. We
                        request that you pay a minimum $20.00 co-pay at the time of your session. We would greatly appreciate
                        your keeping current with your co-payments. If you do not have insurance, a payment schedule will
                        be arranged with you and on your initial visit.
                    </p>
                    <p class="section-head">Court Appearances</p>
                    <p>
                        Due to our heavy clinical schedules, and as a matter of policy, we do not testify in civil or criminal court proceedings.
                        We will, however, supply the court and/or attorneys with a written summary of therapy if the client
                        should so-desire. A signed release of information is required for each summary to be supplied.

                    </p>
                    <p class="section-head">Phone Calls</p>
                    <p>
                        Therapists will try to return phone calls as quickly as possible. Because the therapists have limited time between sessions,
                        please be aware that calls may be returned at the end of the day or the following day. Issues that
                        require more than 10 minutes on the phone may require a scheduled office visit.
